# CryptoSelect
My 2nd project for John Bryce web development class using HTML, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, AJAX, REST API, CANVAS JS & BOOTSTRAP. 

Some of the features that can be found in CryptoSelect include:  
- Coin of interest selection by toggle switch. 
- Expandable information per coin on the homepage. 
- Real time CryptoCurrency updates in graph format. 
- Search Capabilities. 
- 2 APIs used for information retrieval: 
  - https://www.coingecko.com/api 
  - https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ 

To get started, feel free to select up to 5 coins to diplay in the live report. If you would like to choose a sixth, you'll have to replace one of your currently selected coins with a new one.
